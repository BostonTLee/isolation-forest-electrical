        This article provides a comparison of iForest with PCA for fault
        detection. The authors utilize both iForest and Extended iForest,
        noting the advantages of EIF. The authors present visual results
        confirming the effectivenes of EIF in detecting system failures.

        The authors propose Isolation Forest Algorithm for Streaming Data
        (iForestASD), to address the lack of streaming-data methods in anomaly
        detection. The authors use sliding windows to model streaming data. This
        method involves fitting successive iForest models on streaming blocks of
        data, until the anomaly rate is greater than a given threshold. When the
        anomaly rate grows too large, it reflects "concept drift," the idea that
        the model is no longer correctly fit to the data, because the data is
        changing over time. When the threshold for concept drift is met, the
        algorithm is re-fit to the current data, and the loop continues.

        This paper establishes "Grubbs' test." The author provides a theoretical
        framework for detecting if an observation on the largest or smallest end of
        a sample is of the same normal distribution as the remainder of the sample.
        The majority of the paper is very mathematical and derives the distribution
        of the statistic for testing if the highest or lowest observation is an
        outlier, and other cases: Whether the two highest points are outliers,
        whether both the high and low points are outliers, etc.

        The authors present Extended Isolation Forest (EIF). The authors
        motivate changes to the iForest algorithm by showing the geometric
        limitations of simple variable splits. If the data does not have edges
        that are separated by lines along predictors, iForest underperforms. The
        authors use an example of a sinusoid curve with Gaussian noise, where
        the anomalies lie mostly along the peaks of the curve. The original
        iForest algorithm does not pick up the shape of the data. The authors
        propose splitting along randomly-generated hyperplanes, instead of along
        random variables, to address this shortcoming.

        This paper explores anomalous patterns of medical system usage, where an
        anomaly is contextual (can either be over- or under-utilization. In the
        discussion of anomaly detection, the authors use three models (CART, Random
        Forests, and MARS) to predict expected utilization for a patients with
        diabetes (given their medical condition, for each type of utilization), and
        then used Grubbs' test to detect anomalies based on the difference between
        the expected and actual levels of utilization. A patient was marked as
        anomalous if they were flagged by Grubbs' test for at least one type of
        visit.

        This paper introduces the Isolation Forest (iForest) method. The aim of
        the paper is to establish a method that addresses pitfalls of standard
        anomaly detection methods. Standard methods fit models to the normal
        instances, and so are poorly positioned to detect outliers, in some
        cases. Isolation Forest is a method that proposes looking at anomalies
        from a quantitative standpoint: Anomalies are easy to isolate in the
        feature space, because they are "few and different." The authors
        establish the theory of the algorithm and its associated anomaly score,
        and also perform experiments comparing the algorithm to other popular
        anomaly detection methods (KNN and LOF).

        This article first presents a mathematical argument for a new separation
        criterion with respect to numerical predictors. The article proposes
        that for a single predictor, both anomalies and normal instances should
        be clustered, and share a common distribution. By defining anomalies in
        this way, the authors allow for the definition of a separability
        criterion based on probability theory, using the distance between the
        centers of the two classes, and the total "dispersity" of the values for
        a single predictor. The authors then define a gradient descent method
        based on the separability index proposed. The authors then provide an
        experimental evaluation, acknowledging the shortcomings of tree-based
        methods.

        This paper explores the application of a combination of predictive and

        consumption data. The authors propose CEEMD-LSTM for prediction, which
        is a combination of two less parsimonious models, because the authors
        favor high prediction accuracy. In the testing phase, the difference
        between the value predicted by the model and the true value is used as
        input to Grubbs' Test. Subsets of this data are tested for normality
        with Lilliefor's Test, before applying Grubbs' Test to each subset to
        test for abnormality. This approach is used to reduce the
        dimensionality of the problem, while still providing high prediction accuracy.
